# Shadaloo-Labyrinth-RL-Agent

Training a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to solve the shadaloo labyrinth puzzle game. It is a puzzle game that requires you to find a Hamiltonian path from a starting cell to a target cell,
on a rectangular grid with obstacles. For more details about the solution please refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YISC09lHWk0).
